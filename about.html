      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in the beautiful Northwest USA, I'm a proud Oregonian. Starting at age five, I enrolled in a Japanese immersion program in the Portland Public Schools system. Thirteen years later, I graduated from the immersion program and from Ulysses S. Grant High School as a valedictorian. </p>
      
      <p>I attended Hamilton College in upstate New York for my undergraduate and received my degree on May 20th 2018. I continued with my Japanese studies in college, but I also stumbled across a new passion: computer science. From the very first class I took (an OOP course in Python), I was hooked. I loved solving puzzles, learning new programming languages, and writing effective and readable code. </p>
      
      <p>Now, after graduating as a double major in Computer Science and Asian Studies, I am pursuing a career in computer science. I'm open to exploring different roles and specialties - as long as I can continue coding! </p>

      <p>I was an avid reader as a child - my favorite was fantasy. I've since expanded my reading list somewhat but definitely still enjoy stories with adventure and wonder. One of my favorite authors is Terry Pratchett. </p>

      <p>Besides reading, I also enjoy creative activities like knitting, writing, and drawing in my free time. I love to create; that's partly why coding fascinates me! </p>

      <p>In terms of more active hobbies, I rowed on a crew team for four years during high school, and in college I played rugby. I'd love to get back on the water someday, but for now I'll content myself with bike rides and hikes. </p>
