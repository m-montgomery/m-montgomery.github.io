      <h2>HALTING: Senior Honors Thesis</h2>
      <p>In my final semester as an undergraduate student, in fulfillment of a programming-intensive computer science honors thesis, I designed and implemented from scratch a GUI application for simulating finite automata. The application is written in Java; to see its code, read the user's manual, or download the application to run it, <a href="https://github.com/m-montgomery/HALTING" target="_blank">see its Github</a>. </p>

      <p>HALTING (or: Honors Automata Language Theory Including Navigable Graphics) allows the user to quickly build, edit, and run deterministic finite automata. Finite automata (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">finite-state machines</a>) are an abstract concept used in computational theory. </p>

      <p>An automaton is graphically represented per classroom standard: each state is a circle, and transitions are depicted as arrows. After entering an input string, users can simply view the end result (accept or reject) or can step through the input one character at a time, watching the machine transition through its states. Automata can also be saved and loaded, which can greatly improve the efficiency of classtime. </p>

      <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/m-montgomery/HALTING/blob/master/src/resources/UserManual.pdf" target="_blank">user's manual</a> for directions on using HALTING. </p>

      <h2>CSPy: Summer Research</h2>
      <p>In the summer of 2016, I was hired by the Hamilton College Computer Science department to work on developing a programming language. Along with another student, that summer I developed a compiler for a statically typed dialect of Python called CSPy, which is intended for classroom use. </p>
      <p>CSPy aims to retain the user-friendliness of Python for introductory students while encouraging conscientious coding through features such as explicitly declared variables. We expanded an existing grammar and developed comprehensive semantic type-checking and a system for translating CSPy source code to native Python. </p>
